This project is the application of a Huffman coding.

According to the Huffman coding, the characters that are the most frequent in the input
are the ones that have the shortest huffman code.
This gives a Huffman tree, a binary tree where the left son is attributed the number 0
and the right one has the code 1.

How to build a Huffman tree ?

Order the frequencies of characters in ascending order. Then take the two first ones
(the least frequent ones), they are now the two children of a node which value is the
sum of the left and right trees' frequencies.
